INTRODUCTION
-In the ever-evolving field of computer vision, Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a pivotal
technology, driving advancements in image recognition,
classification, and analysis. This project leverages the
power of CNNs to tackle a challenging and practical
problem in the domain of fashion—classifying apparel
images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.​

-FashionMNIST serves as a more contemporary and
challenging dataset compared to the traditional MNIST
dataset of handwritten digits. Comprising 70,000 grayscale
images across 10 fashion categories.​


GOAL
-Develop a model that can classify images of clothing items by
item type​

-Optimize model architecture to minimize overfitting and
maximize validation accuracy​

-The model should be able to classify new images accurately and
be able to classify images with at least a 90% accuracy​

-Determine how models could be improved by analyzing resulting
models' performance​

-Understand final models' weaknesses for further system
integration​


FINAL CONCLUSION
-Successfully trains and evaluated multiple deep learning
models on the Fashion MNIST dataset​

-Visualization and error analysis provide insights into the model's
strengths and weaknesses​

-Final model has difficulty differentiating between T-Shirt Top, Shirts, and
pull overs​

-For further improvements to performance, techniques like data
augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or using a more complex
architecture (e.g., CNN with additional layers) could be
explored.
